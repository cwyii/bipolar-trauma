<center><i>Inherent, Predisposed Bipolar</i></center>

<p>I was born in New York City in 1999 and grew up in Westchester, New York, as the middle child in a loving family. I did okay in school, with constantly fluctuating scores. I spent most of my teen years, eighth-12th grades, at boarding schools and began having issues in the fall of 2015. My vision would double and blur, and I started seeing flashing lights. Whenever I returned to the bench during hockey, I would experience a boat-like, swaying dizziness.</p>

<p>My high school doctor, a conventional concussion specialist, misdiagnosed me. She quickly kept the individual athletes from participating in their afternoon sports club and, therefore, was not well-liked.</p>

<p>One winter night, I was free-skating with some friends, shooting pucks, when my vision blurred, and I saw light auras. I had previously dealt with concussions; they were all slightly different, but this didn&#39t line up with any of their symptoms. It was late, but I went to the nurses&#39 office. They diagnosed me with a concussion and, as protocol, held me for the night.</p>

<p>The next day, Dr. Fauntas also diagnosed me with a concussion. Stuck in the health center bedroom with no symptoms any longer, I called my parents. <q>This is not a concussion,</q> I told them. They were quick to contact the health center and explain the situation.</p>

<p>On December 8, 2015, I was seen by the faculty of NYU Radiology for an MRI, which showed nothing abnormal. Then, my parents took me to Dr. Rucker of NYU Neurology Associates to further investigate my symptoms of <q>migraine, concussion, dizziness, diplopia.</q> After a <q>videonystagmography,</q> she prescribed medicine for vertigo.</p>

<p>I continued to experience symptoms over the course of the next few months.</p>

<p>On February 4, 2016, I visited NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center to ensure I wasn&#39t having seizures. I was hooked up to an electroencephalogram, which was monitored by 24-hour-a-day video surveillance. The doctors put a glue-like substance in my hair to increase connectivity with the twenty-seven wires attached to my scalp.</p>

<p>The nurses checked on me periodically to give me plates similar to those of a 2000s-era school lunch, and I lay there in the hospital bed, nearly motionless but constantly tickling with anxious vibrations.</p>

<p>Dr. Bluvstein addressed <q>post-trauma response, paroxysmal spells, migraine equivalent, dizzy spells, family history of anxiety disorder.</q> On February 7, 2016, I was discharged with a principal problem diagnosis of paroxysmal spells and an active problem diagnosis of convulsion.</p>

<center><i>The Event</i></center>

<p>Almost a year later, I lost my best friend, Pierce. Our mothers taught together in New York City, and our dads really <q>got</q> each other. I was part of the Jarck family.</p>

<p>The day that he died, October 15, 2017, my body physically and mentally fell apart.</p>

<p>About to order at a Dunkin&#39 Donuts&#39 just five minutes from my boarding school, my phone rang. I casually stepped outside, answered the phone and received the most awful news from a classmate of mine from my best friend&#39s hometown.</p>

<p>I skipped breakfast to return to school, and it took me a short ride back to campus to process what had happened.</p>

<p>Back at school, I collapsed with grief. My cousin escorted me, crying and with blurry vision, to a gathering of students from Pierce&#39s hometown, where we mourned together. I can&#39t recall sharp details from then on.</p>

<p>Later, my father picked me up. On my way home, Pierce&#39s father called my dad. The call was on speaker in the car, and it was the most terrible thing I have ever had to listen to; I was in shock. Pierce took his life with a gun from his father's safe.</p>

<center><i>Take the time to check on your friends; anything is something, whether it is a text, a phone call, a FaceTime, or an in-person interaction.</i></center>

<p>Trauma is a vicious vampire that drains your every last emotion. It is physical gaslighting; every nerve tingles in your body until you feel insane. Pierce and I were more like brothers than easy friends. It took most of our childhood, petty squabbling and fighting, for us to realize we were best friends. I think about Pierce every day. I spent many of my darkest times thinking about my future wedding and what his role should have been. He was best-man material. I contemplated suicide. It has taken years for me to feel like I have fully processed and even been able to grow from this loss. Even today, I&#39m not sure I&#39m there.</p>

<p>My trauma consequences have been quite dire. My bipolar symptoms spiked at the time of Pierce&#39s death, which my doctors attribute to trauma. My grieving has been a complicated process. I&#39ve heard people use the term <q>broken.</q> Before this, I never knew what it meant. While I&#39ve had two concussions, the many <q>concussions</q> the doctor claimed I had proved to be my bipolar, and my predisposure to bipolar ignited when I lost Pierce.</p>

<center><i>I didn&#39t have a concussion; I had a lot else going on in my head.</i></center>

<p>Technically, I have PTSS and PTSD, but am diagnosed with PTSD. The differences are slightly nuanced, but so is the English language. Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome signifies the time relative to the victim&#39s symptoms. PTSS is developed earlier, while PTSD is more concretely set.</p>

<p>According to the DSM-5, the Diagnostics and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders, disorders are <q>a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual.</q> A disorder entails a pattern of symptoms that leads to distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p>

<p>When we consider post-traumatic stress as a disorder, we recognize it as a significant syndrome, meaning it has a profound impact on an individual's life. PTSD as a syndrome identifies a pattern of psychological stress responses that can be significant and may require intervention but does not classify the individual's experience as inherently pathological; this can reduce stigma and accentuate the natural capacity for resilience and recovery. Traumatic stress is a part of a normal continuum in response to traumatic experiences.</p>
 
<center><i>PTSD</i></center>

<p>My father lost his brother in 2003 to colon cancer. I&#39ve noticed that the grieving seems different, based on the <q>delivery</q> of the death. Death is either a violent surprise or a drawn-out process. Losing Pierce was so sudden.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/box/part1_ch3.box16/">Symptoms of PTSD</a> include recurrent trauma, dissociative reactions, psychological stress, memory alterations, feeling detached or estranged from others, and diminished interest in activities.</p> 

<p>I thought PTSD was something that only happens to soldiers, first responders and abuse victims.</p> 

<center><i>Forty-eight thousand people took their lives in 2021.</i></center>

<p>Suicide is the leading cause of death in the United States. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html">In 2021, it is estimated that 12.3 million adults <q>seriously thought about suicide.</q> In the same year, 3.5 million adults planned to take their lives, and 1.7 million attempted suicide.</a> These numbers don’t even include the increasing number of suicides of minors. Mental conditions like anxiety, depression, and bipolar directly affect suicidal ideation.</p>

<p>The CDC states, <q>While the causes of suicide vary, suicide prevention strategies share two goals: to reduce factors that increase risk and to increase factors that promote resilience or coping.</q></p>

<p>Anyone at risk for taking their own life should not have easy access to lethal methods. Suicides involving firearms account for approximately half of all suicides in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db433.htm">suicide rates among individuals aged ten to 24 have increased more than 30 percent since 2000.</a> By 2017, suicides surpassed homicides as a leading cause of death for this age group, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db352-h.pdf">doubling the number of average homicides annually.</a></p>

<p>Mental disorders are not just confined to that abstract, nebulous realm of <q>brain and mood,</q> though that&#39s how a lot of people think of them. Mental health is at play in nearly every situation where someone is hurt or killed through violence, whether an assault, a homicide, or a suicide.</p>

<p>Pierce&#39s suicide forced me to confront my own bipolar symptoms, and PTSS has taught me that mental health is an ongoing process of healing and growth. I honor Pierce&#39s memory in all the ways I can, but in honoring Pierce, I realize the focus on my own health is ever-so-important; I must honor Pierce by honoring myself – emphasizing my mental and physical well-being. The power of being there for others is enormous, but you can&#39t help others until you help yourself. My proactive approach to mental health is not just about coping but about thriving in an ever-darkening world and helping others to do the same. Reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. I embrace psychiatry, psychology, and open conversations as tools to manage my well-being and others. It is not something I can do alone sometimes, and I know others need assistance, too. I send those texts, call my friends, and share my story – by this and simply listening, I can become a sign of hope to those who might be silently struggling.</p>
